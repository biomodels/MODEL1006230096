**Abstract:**   
The biochemical regulation of energy metabolism (EM) allows cells to modulate
their energetic output depending on available substrates and requirements. To
this end, numerous biomolecular mechanisms exist that allow the sensing of the
energetic state and corresponding adjustment of enzymatic reaction rates. This
regulation is known to induce dynamic systems properties such as oscillations
or perfect adaptation. Although the various mechanisms of energy regulation
have been studied in detail from many angles at the experimental and
theoretical levels, no framework is available for the systematic analysis of
EM from a control systems perspective. In this study, we have used principles
well known in control to clarify the basic system features that govern EM. The
major result is a subdivision of the biomolecular mechanisms of energy
regulation in terms of widely used engineering control mechanisms:
proportional, integral, derivative control, and structures: feedback, cascade
and feed-forward control. Evidence for each mechanism and structure is
demonstrated and the implications for systems properties are shown through
simulations. As the equivalence between biological systems and control
components presented here is generic, it is also hypothesized that our work
could eventually have an applicability that is much wider than the focus of
the current study.
